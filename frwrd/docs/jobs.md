# Jobs and schedules

Jobs make frwrd useful while you are not in a conversation. Each job is a
user-owned Markdown runbook in the configured assistant repository's `jobs/`
directory. TOML frontmatter defines execution policy; the Markdown body is
sent verbatim to a fresh backend session.

The schedule definition lives in the same Markdown file as the job. frwrd
evaluates that definition and stores its run and delivery state. For every run:

- `SOUL.md` is supplied automatically as identity and working instructions;
- files under `context/` are optional shared information and are not inserted
  automatically; keep task-specific instructions in the job;
- the job body is the fresh request, without chat history or template expansion;
- `primary_delivery` in frwrd configuration selects where scheduled results go.

## Create a job

Create `<assistant_root>/jobs/repo-review.md`:

```markdown
+++
version = 1
timeout = "5m"
backend = "codex"
+++

Review repositories with uncommitted work. Summarize the risk and the next
useful action. Do not change files or remote state.
```

Job names are lowercase ASCII slugs made from letters, digits, and hyphens.
Files must be regular UTF-8 Markdown files directly inside the derived
`<assistant_root>/jobs` directory.
Subdirectories and symlinks are rejected.

Frontmatter fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | yes | Format version, currently `1` |
| `timeout` | yes | Positive duration no greater than `jobs_max_timeout` |
| `workdir` | no | Existing working directory for the backend; defaults to `assistant_root` |
| `backend` | no | `claude`, `codex`, or `pi`; defaults to `jobs_agent`, then root `agent` |
| `evals` | no | Reusable Markdown agent eval names from `<assistant_root>/evals/` |
| `triggers` | no | One or more cron trigger tables |

Unknown fields are errors. The assistant repository is a valid work directory.
A job work directory may not overlap frwrd state, database, audit log, job lock
paths, or a loaded config stored outside the assistant repository.

## Validate and inspect jobs

```sh
frwrd job validate
frwrd job list
frwrd job show repo-review
```

Validation reports every valid and invalid file. An invalid job is disabled
individually and does not stop messaging or other valid jobs. Validation does
not activate an enabled schedule.

## Evaluate completed work

Jobs can assign one or more reusable agent evals:

```toml
evals = ["writing-style", "task-completion"]
```

Each name resolves to one non-empty regular Markdown file directly under
`<assistant_root>/evals/`. Names use the same lowercase ASCII slug format as
jobs. Symlinks, missing files, duplicate names, invalid UTF-8, more than 16
assigned evals, files larger than 64 KiB, and assigned evals larger than 256 KiB
in total are rejected during job validation. Assigned eval contents are included
in the validated job snapshot, so changing an eval changes the snapshot used for
future claims.

For example, create `<assistant_root>/evals/writing-style.md`:

```markdown
# Writing style

Fail work that uses em dashes, unsupported claims, or needlessly complex words.
```

After a job returns successfully, frwrd starts one fresh evaluator session using
the same backend, timeout, and work directory. The evaluator receives the
original job, final response, and every assigned eval, then must finish with
`VERDICT: PASS` or `VERDICT: FAIL`. frwrd disables evaluator shell access,
external MCP tools, extensions, browser integrations, and session persistence.
Codex project instructions are also disabled. Some backends may retain
non-mutating built-in utility tools. The first version evaluates the returned
response and does not inspect work-directory artifacts.

Evaluation is recorded separately as `running`, `passed`, `failed`, `error`, or
`not_requested`. A failed or malformed evaluation does not rewrite the result,
rerun the job, or change a successful execution into a failed execution.
Scheduled delivery includes the evaluation verdict and failure details.

## Run a job manually

```sh
frwrd job run repo-review
frwrd job runs repo-review
```

A manual run executes in the invoking CLI process and prints its result there.
It does not proactively message a channel. frwrd records and claims the run in
SQLite before starting the backend and holds a non-blocking per-job advisory
lock for the run's lifetime.

If the same job is already active, the new attempt is recorded as
`skipped_overlap`. A fresh claim can recover a stale claim only after acquiring
the released OS lock, so a live process is not reclaimed from database state
alone.

## Schedule a job

Add one or more five-field cron triggers:

```toml
[[triggers]]
id = "weekday-morning"
kind = "cron"
schedule = "0 8 * * 1-5"
timezone = "Europe/London"
enabled = true
```

Then configure a delivery destination:

```toml
[primary_delivery]
channel = "telegram"
target = "123456789"
```

Scheduling starts only when the primary destination is enabled and
allowlisted. A missing or invalid destination disables new scheduled starts
without affecting conversations or manual jobs.

Saving `enabled = true` creates a schedule activation proposal. The Markdown
file remains available for validation, inspection, and `frwrd job run`, but the
scheduler does not plan the enabled trigger until the proposal is approved.
frwrd assigns each proposal to one allowlisted conversation when it presents a
durable question showing the exact job name, content revision, enabled cron
schedules, effective backend, timeout, work directory, and primary delivery
target. That persisted identity is the review owner; concurrent conversations
cannot adopt or answer its question. Reply with the question UUID followed by
the number for Approve or Reject. A number alone is rejected so a delayed reply
cannot select a replacement question. The question expires after 24 hours.

Approval is bound to the exact channel, sender, chat, thread or topic, validated
file revision, file identity, effective execution settings, and delivery
target. A file edit, invalid file, symlink or path replacement, schedule change,
backend change, timeout change, work-directory change, or delivery-target
change invalidates the prior activation before it can run. A later valid
revision receives a new review. Disabled triggers and jobs without triggers do
not require activation review.

Use `frwrd job reviews [<name>]` to inspect current and historical schedule
review state. A manually edited schedule is still detected and kept inactive;
the next completed request from an allowlisted conversation can receive its
review question.

frwrd runs at most `jobs_max_workers` scheduled jobs concurrently. It does not
catch up cron occurrences missed while offline. Daylight-saving gaps are
skipped; repeated local times run once at their first instant. Cron expressions
whose selected months and days can never form a calendar date are rejected
during job validation.

## Complete assistant example

The [daily inbox triage job](https://github.com/utachicodes/frwrd/blob/main/examples/assistant/jobs/daily-inbox-triage.md)
keeps global identity separate while making the scheduled runbook self-contained:

```text
SOUL.md
jobs/daily-inbox-triage.md
```

That one job file contains its schedule, triage priorities, output format, and
safety rules. It uses email tools configured in the selected agent, drafts no
replies, and performs no external side effects. Its schedule is disabled by
default. Set `enabled = true` in the job only after configuring the email tools
and primary delivery destination.

## Execution and delivery guarantees

- Every job and evaluator run uses a fresh backend session, without chat history.
- Codex and Claude jobs bypass interactive permissions so unattended work can
  complete. Evaluators remain restricted.
- frwrd does not retry failed or timed-out backend execution because the agent
  may have completed external side effects before failing.
- Success, failure, timeout, overlap, and delivery state are stored separately.
- Scheduled output is persisted before delivery.
- Delivery retries use the stored result and never rerun the backend.
- Delivery is claimed across gateway processes. Normal partial-message retries
  resume from the first unsent chunk. frwrd checkpoints each successful chunk
  and bounds a delivery attempt below its claim lease so an active worker cannot
  be reclaimed. Delivery can still produce an at-least-once duplicate after a
  process crash between a channel send and its checkpoint, or after a
  delivery-state persistence failure, because channel APIs do not provide
  atomic delivery.
- Queued runs and pending delivery survive restart. Interrupted execution is
  not automatically replayed.

Use `frwrd job runs [<name>]` to inspect execution state, evaluation state,
delivery attempts, destination, bounded results, and error details.

## Agent-created jobs

When a user asks for a job, the assistant writes the complete runbook directly
to `<assistant_root>/jobs/<lowercase-slug>.md` and runs `frwrd job validate`.
There is no separate draft-file or installation approval step. The selected
agent's filesystem permissions control whether it can change the assistant
repository. A new or changed enabled schedule remains inactive until its
separate activation review succeeds.

For an assistant repository created before this change, replace any `AGENTS.md`
instruction that says to propose jobs through approval with the direct-write
rule above. The gateway's runtime instruction overrides that old rule, but
updating the repository keeps its checked-in guidance accurate.

Pending draft-install approvals from older frwrd versions are cancelled during
database migration. Replying to one explains that the job must be requested
again. On upgrade to schedule activation review, each valid enabled schedule
whose exact revision exists when the first upgraded command opens job state is
captured as the migration baseline. Those revisions are recorded as approved
and activated once when a valid primary destination exists. If that first
command has no valid primary destination, frwrd records an empty baseline and
closes the migration without grandfathering any schedules. Disabled and invalid
jobs are not grandfathered.

!!! warning

    Schedule activation review is not an agent permission prompt. After
    activation, frwrd runs Codex jobs with full access and no prompts and Claude
    jobs in `bypassPermissions` mode. Treat every activated job as code
    execution by the frwrd service user, review changes to the assistant
    repository, and allow only trusted senders.
