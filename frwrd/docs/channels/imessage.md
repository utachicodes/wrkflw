# iMessage

frwrd supports one-to-one iMessage conversations on macOS. It reads the local
Messages database and sends replies with `osascript`. It does not use a cloud
iMessage API or expose a network service.

## Requirements

- macOS with Messages signed in
- Full Disk Access for the terminal or service process running frwrd
- access to `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` and `~/Library/Messages/Attachments`
- `osascript` on `PATH`
- `/usr/bin/sips` for HEIC and HEIF image conversion

Run `frwrd doctor` from the same user and environment as the long-running
service. A successful interactive check does not prove that a separate service
account has Full Disk Access.

## Self-chat configuration

Use a Messages conversation with your own iMessage handle:

```toml
channel = "imessage"
agent = "codex"

[imessage]
self_handles = ["you@icloud.com"]
```

frwrd identifies self-chat from the chat identifier and accepts your own
messages in that conversation. It adds a reply marker to outbound messages so
they are not fed back into the agent.

## Allow another sender

```toml
[imessage]
self_handles = ["you@icloud.com"]
allow_from = ["+15551234567", "trusted@example.com"]
```

Only direct messages from these handles are accepted. Phone numbers are
matched after formatting is removed. Email addresses are matched without case
sensitivity.

Treat every allowed handle as an operator of the configured backend. A sender
can ask the agent to use any capability allowed by that agent's configuration.

## Image messages

Send up to four JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, or HEIF images in one accepted
conversation, with or without message text. Their combined prepared size must
be at most 6 MiB. Each HEIC or HEIF source must be at most 32 MiB before local
conversion. Images work with Claude Code, Codex, and Pi.

Polling reads attachment paths, byte-size hints, and MIME type hints from
`chat.db`; it does not open the attachment files. After the direct-message,
sender, reply-marker, and message checks pass, an accepted attachment with no
filename gets a three-poll grace period. frwrd leaves that row unacknowledged so
the cursor cannot skip the image, while rejected and later ready messages can
continue. If the filename is still blank after the grace period, the worker
treats it as missing and sends the safe fallback. The worker canonicalizes each
ready path and requires it to remain under `~/Library/Messages/Attachments` (or
the `Attachments` directory beside a custom `imessage.db_path`). Missing files,
directories, escaping symlinks, and unsupported documents are rejected with a
safe retry reply before an agent starts.

JPEG, PNG, and WebP files go through the shared byte limit and signature
validation directly. frwrd converts HEIC and HEIF locally with macOS `sips` in
an owner-only temporary directory, validates the resulting JPEG against the
same shared limit, and removes the conversion file immediately. The prepared
agent handoff files are also owner-only and are removed after the turn.
Conversation history retains only the message text or an image placeholder,
not image bytes or local attachment paths. Review the configured backend's
image and data controls before using this feature.

Sending generated images back through iMessage is not supported.

## What frwrd ignores

- group chats
- tapbacks and Messages system rows
- blank messages without an image attachment
- stickers, videos, and Live Photo video components
- messages from handles outside the allowlist
- frwrd's own replies containing the built-in frwrd reply marker

The channel expects a recent macOS Messages schema. `frwrd doctor` and runtime
logs report database access or query failures rather than silently accepting
no messages.

## Thread keys and routing

Self-chat keys use `imessage:self:<handle>`. Allowed direct-message keys use
`imessage:dm:<handle>`.

```toml
[[routes]]
thread = "imessage:self:you@icloud.com"
agent = "claude"
```

See [configuration](../configuration.md#routing) for route precedence.

## Restart behavior

On the first iMessage start, frwrd records the newest existing Messages row
without running it. Send a new message after the gateway starts. Later starts
continue after the last completed row stored in `frwrd.db`.

frwrd stores both the last completed Messages row and accepted conversation
turns in `frwrd.db`. It advances the cursor only after a row is ignored or
completed. An earlier in-flight row prevents later completed rows from pushing
the cursor past it. Existing `state.json` data is imported once on upgrade and
the original file remains as a recovery copy.

If a generated outbound reply was stored before a crash, restart delivers the
stored reply without generating a different second answer. A crash before the
backend result is persisted may repeat backend work.

## Troubleshooting

### `chat.db` cannot be opened

Grant Full Disk Access to the exact terminal or service host, restart that
process, and rerun:

```sh
frwrd doctor
```

Image messages also require that the same process can read
`~/Library/Messages/Attachments`. Recheck Full Disk Access if text works but
images fail.

### Messages are ignored

Confirm the conversation is one-to-one and that its sender or chat identifier
matches `self_handles` or `allow_from`. Check the audit log for the rejection
reason without enabling message content logging.

### Interactive use works but `launchd` does not

Use absolute paths in the service definition, ensure the backend is on the
service `PATH`, and grant Full Disk Access to the process that actually opens
Messages. See [the service guide](../services.md#macos-launchd).
