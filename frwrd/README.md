# frwrd

### The wrkflw gateway. Turn your coding agent into a 24/7 personal assistant.

Message Claude Code, Codex, or Pi from your phone. Schedule work for later.
Keep the agent and its data on your own machine. Conversations mirror into
your wrkflw inbox as tasks when the wrkflw control-plane integration is on.

## Examples

## The mission

Good coding agents should be useful beyond an open terminal.

frwrd makes the agent you already trust available through iMessage, Telegram,
or Slack. It can answer a message, continue a conversation, or run a Markdown
job on a schedule. Give it clear context and a useful set of jobs, and it can
act as your AI chief of staff. Your assistant files stay in a Git repository
you own.

frwrd is a small bridge, not a new agent. Your coding agent still controls the
models, tools, permissions, and reasoning.

## Part of wrkflw

frwrd is the gateway part of wrkflw, the control plane for assistant-driven
work. With the wrkflw mirror enabled (`[wrkflw] mirror = true`), frwrd keeps one
wrkflw inbox task per conversation thread: the first inbound message creates
the task, and later messages and every reply become task entries. Your chats
land in the same inbox as everything else you run, and stay as organized as
your board.

## A simpler alternative

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and
[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) are powerful
assistant platforms with their own agent runtimes, tools, skills, memory, and
messaging layers.

frwrd does not replace your agent. One small Rust binary adds messaging and
schedules to Claude Code, Codex, or Pi.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Message["Message from you<br/>iMessage · Telegram · Slack"]
    Jobs["Scheduled<br/>Markdown jobs"]
    Repo["Assistant repository<br/>SOUL.md · context · jobs"]
    frwrd["frwrd<br/>message gateway · scheduler · history"]
    Agent["Your coding agent<br/>Claude Code · Codex · Pi"]
    Reply["frwrd returns the result<br/>to your chat"]

    Message --> frwrd
    Jobs --> frwrd
    frwrd -->|dispatch| Agent
    Repo -. context .-> Agent
    Agent --> Reply
```

## What it does

- Runs on your Mac or Linux machine
- Connects private iMessage, Telegram, and Slack chats
- Uses your existing Claude Code, Codex, or Pi setup
- Keeps conversations and job history between restarts
- Runs one-off or scheduled Markdown jobs
- Opens no inbound network port

## Get started

You need Apple Silicon macOS or x86_64 Linux, Git, and one supported coding
agent installed and signed in. iMessage requires macOS.

Install the latest release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utachicodes/frwrd/main/install.sh | sh
```

The binary goes to `~/.local/bin`. If your shell cannot find `frwrd`, add that
directory to `PATH` before continuing.

Create a Git-backed home for your assistant:

```sh
frwrd init ~/Code/assistant
```

This creates a Git repository containing `SOUL.md`, shared instructions in
`AGENTS.md`, a `CLAUDE.md` reference to those instructions, `context/`, `evals/`,
`jobs/`, and a versioned frwrd capability skill for Claude Code, Codex, and Pi.
It then records the repository path in `$FRWRD_HOME/config.toml`. `FRWRD_HOME`
defaults to `~/.frwrd`.

Edit `$FRWRD_HOME/config.toml` to connect a chat channel. A small Telegram setup
looks like this:

```toml
channel = "telegram"
agent = "codex"
assistant_root = "~/Code/assistant"

[telegram]
bot_token = "token-from-BotFather"
allow_user_ids = [123456789]
```

Check the setup and start frwrd:

```sh
frwrd doctor
frwrd
```

For channel setup, assistant design, service installation, jobs, permissions,
and every config option, follow the
[developer docs](https://utachicodes.github.io/frwrd/).

## Build from source

Install the stable Rust toolchain, then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/utachicodes/frwrd.git
cd frwrd
cargo build --locked --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/frwrd`. See the
[contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development checks and documentation
setup.
